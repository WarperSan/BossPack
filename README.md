# Boss Pack
This mod adds multiple bosses with their own mechanic. All details are explained in each section.

Are the bosses possible to beat in a normal game ? I have no idea. GL

Notes: 
- A Red bloon has a speed of 25 and a Bad has a speed of 4.5
- Math.Floor(x) means that it only keeps the integer part of the number (1 => 1; 1.3 => 1; 1.99999 => 1; 2 => 2)

# If you want to use BossPack's UI with your own custom boss
If you create a custom boss and you give it a HealthPercentTriggerModel, your boss will be able to use the boss bar that is given by BossPack. 

Note that BossPack manages bosses that have **evenly spaced skulls** (e.g.: 2 skulls will be placed at 66% and 33%). Plus, the boss icon is taken from Bloon.bloonModel.icon
